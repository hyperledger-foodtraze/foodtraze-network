## Features

### 🔗 Blockchain-Powered Traceability  
Built on Hyperledger Fabric, ensuring tamper-proof, decentralized recording of every event in the food supply chain.

### 🌾 End-to-End Lifecycle Tracking  
Captures all farm events — from sowing to harvesting, storage, processing, and distribution — with Key Data Elements (KDEs).

### 📱 Farmer-Friendly Mobile App  
Intuitive mobile interface for farmers to easily record real-time data with minimal effort, even in low-connectivity areas.

### 🌍 Multilingual & Global Ready  
Adaptable for different geographies, language requirements, and farming standards.

### 🧪 Ingredient & Lab Test Traceability  
Tracks each ingredient source and allows uploading of lab reports for pesticide, contamination, and quality checks.

### 📦 Consumer Transparency via QR Code  
Generates scannable QR codes showing the full story of the product, enhancing trust and enabling informed choices.

### 🛠️ Open Source & Modular  
Freely available, customizable platform that can scale for different crops, geographies, or sectors like poultry and processed foods.

## Why FoodTraze?

- **Immutable Tracking** – Every transaction and update is recorded permanently, creating a verifiable audit trail.
- **End-to-End Visibility** – Producers, distributors, retailers, and regulators can trace the full history of food items in real-time.
- **Decentralized Trust** – Built on Hyperledger Fabric, ensuring privacy, scalability, and security in a multi-party environment.
- **Developer-Friendly** – Modular codebase with Docker-based deployment, REST APIs, and smart contract SDKs for fast integration.

## Network Participants

FoodTraze models a real-world food supply chain using distinct participant roles on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.

### Food Producer
The starting point of the supply chain — farmers or primary producers who generate raw food materials (e.g., vegetables, dairy, grains). They log harvest details, batch IDs, origin data, and environmental conditions.

### Food Processor
Entities that transform raw materials into consumable or packaged goods. They record data on processing stages, lot combinations, quality checks, and certification (e.g., cleaning, milling, packaging).

### Food Distributor
Responsible for logistics and warehousing. They update the chain with shipment events, transit conditions, handling logs, and destination tracking for each batch of goods.

### Food Retailer
The final node before consumer access. Retailers record stock intake, shelf life, disposal (if any), and sales metadata, ensuring traceability extends to the point of sale.
